Space Remover

This script is extremely simple and is something I wrote to solve a problem I was having.
The script basically just replaces all spaces greater than 1 with a single space. I use this to check my spacing in documents.

How to run the script.

First give yourself permission
<pre>	
<code>$ chmod u+x RmSpaces.bash</code>
</pre>

Second run the script and include file name
<pre>
<code>$ ./RmSpaces.bash [file]</code>
</pre>
