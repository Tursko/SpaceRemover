# Space Remover

This script is extremely simple and is something I wrote to solve a problem I was having.
The script basically just replaces all spaces greater than 1 with a single space. I use this to check my spacing in documents. I made this to try out sed.

### How to run the script.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tursko/SpaceRemover.git
$ cd SpaceRemover
$ chmod u+x RmSpaces.bash
$ ./RmSpaces.bash [file]
```
