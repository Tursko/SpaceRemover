### Space Remover

This script is extremely simple and is something I wrote to solve a problem I was having.
The script basically just replaces all spaces greater than 1 with a single space. I use this to check my spacing in documents.

### How to run the script.

First give yourself permission:
```	
$ chmod u+x RmSpaces.bash
```

Second run the script and include file name:
```
$ ./RmSpaces.bash [file]
```
